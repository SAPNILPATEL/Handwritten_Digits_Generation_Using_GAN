# Generative Adversarial Network for MNIST Handwritten Digits in Keras

This repository contains an implementation of a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) for generating MNIST handwritten digits from scratch using the Keras deep learning framework. GANs consist of two neural networks, a generator, and a discriminator, that compete against each other in a game to improve the quality of generated data. In this project, I will create a GAN to generate realistic-looking handwritten digits resembling the ones in the MNIST dataset.

## Introduction

Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are a class of machine learning models that have shown remarkable success in generating realistic data samples. In this project, I aim to create a GAN model to generate handwritten digits similar to the ones found in the MNIST dataset, a classic benchmark in the field of computer vision and machine learning.

## Prerequisites

Before you can run the code in this repository, you'll need the following:

- Python 3.x
- Keras
- TensorFlow
- Matplotlib (for visualizing the generated images)

## Results

Here are some example images generated by the GAN:

These images were generated after training the model for 50 epochs. You can further improve the quality of generated digits by training for more epochs or experimenting with different model architectures and hyperparameters.
