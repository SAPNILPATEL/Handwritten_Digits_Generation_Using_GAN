## Generative Adversarial Network

- GANs are a type of artificial intelligence model consisting of two neural networks: a generator and a discriminator. The generator creates synthetic data resembling real examples, while the discriminator tries to distinguish between real and fake data. Through competition, GANs generate high-quality synthetic data and have applications in image synthesis, data augmentation, and more.
